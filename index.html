      <h5><strong>Cultures in Japan</strong></h5>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey"><strong>1. Chopstick</strong></p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">Good table manners are highly regarded in Japanes culture and correctly using chopsticks is an important part of polite dining. So, when using chopsticks in Japan, don't stab or cut your food with them. Instead, you should lift the food as it is to your mouth. Don't point at something with your chopsticks, as this is rude in Japanese culture. Meanwhile, you should never leave your chopsticks sticking upright in a bowl of rice, as this is associated with funeral customs.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey"><strong>2. Bowing</strong></p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">Bowing (known as ojigi) is the traditional form of greeting Japan. However, bowing can also be used to indicate gratitude, congratulations or an apology. In casual daily situations, a bow is often a simple nod of the head. Meanwhile, a longer and deeper bow is more respectful and can signify a formal apology or sincere thanks. Don't worry if you're just visiting, it's completely acceptable for foreigners to shake hands in Japan.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey"><strong>3. Slurping noodles</strong></p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">There are lots of interesting dining traditions in Japan, but slurping noodles has to be one of the most fun. When Japanese diners slurp their noodles, it's seen as both a sign of enjoyment and a compliment to the chef. So next time you order ramen or yakisoba in Japan, feel free to slurp to your heart's content.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey"><strong>4. Onsen Etiquette</strong></p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">Visitors to onsens or hot springs baths, are required to bathe naked in Japan. Traditional onsens do not allow swimsuits, so everyone must shower thoroughly before entering the baths. This means that visitors leave their clothes and large towels in the locker room and take just a small towel with them to the bathing area.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey"><strong>5. Morning Exercise</strong></p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">Health is important to Japanese culture and the country's tradition of morning exercise reflects that. Rajio Taiso, introduced by Emperor Hirohito, is a radio exercise program that's been broadcast daily since 1928. It plays every morning for 10 minutes and it's mostly followed by school children and the elderly.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey"><strong>6. Sitting seiza</strong></p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">Seiza, which means sitting with your legs folded underneath you, is the traditional way to sit on Japanese tatami floors. At formal occasions, sitting seiza is considered appropriate and respectful. Even so, it's a difficult position for the average person to hold. Older Japanese people sometimes sit with their legs out in front of them, which is completely acceptable.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey"><strong>7. Pouring drinks</strong></p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">The Japanese consider it's impolite to pour your own drink at dinner parties. So, it's best to pour everyone else's drinks and then wait for someone else to pour yours. </p><br>
    
      <h5><strong>Japan famous for..</strong></h5>
     <p class="w3-text-dark-grey"><strong>1. Manga & Anime</strong></p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">Speaking of geek cultures, we can't ignore one of Japan's greatest contributions to global entertainment; anime and manga. Anime is a term that describes Japanese animation, while manga refers to Japanese comics or graphic novels. </p>
       <p class="w3-text-dark-grey"><strong>2. Samurai</strong></p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">Ever wondered about the history of samurai? During the Heian Period (794-1185), Japan was divided into independent kingdoms fighting with each other. To protect their territories, the Japanese feudal lords required men for defense and thus, a class of trained warriors called the samurai began to emerge.</p>
       <p class="w3-text-dark-grey"><strong>3. Safety and low crime rates</strong></p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">Besides trains that arrive on time, Japan is famous for being one of the safest and peaceful countries in the world. While Japan is not immune to national disasters like earthquakes, it benefits from low crime rates, limited access to firearms, and the constant presence of police officers and law enforcement. Even petty crimes like theft occur less frequently in Japan. Some tourists have experienced misplacing their mobile phones in Japan, only to return to the same place to find that it's still there.</p>

    <div id="Thailand" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card w3-yellow">
      <h5><strong>Social Etiquette in Thailand</strong></h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><strong>1. Naming conventions</strong></p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The first name is usually preceded by the word 'Khun' (pronounced 'Koon) which is used as a blanket term to refer to Miss, Mrs or Mr. For example, Khun Mary or Khun Simon. On the other hand, people of importance like teachers, professors or monks, the first name should be preceeded with 'Ajarn'. Surnames are reserved for very formal occasions or written documentation. It is not uncommon for Thais to assign nicknames to each other.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><strong>2. Greeting</strong></p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The ‘wai’ is the traditional form of greeting, given by the person of lower status to the person of higher status. It is the common form of greeting and adheres to strict rules of protocol.
 The standard form is by raising both hands, palms joined with the fingers pointing upwards as if in prayer, lightly touching the body somewhere between the chest and the forehead. The wai is both a sign of respect as well as a greeting. Respect and courtesy are demonstrated by the height at which the hands are held and how low the head comes down to meet the thumbs of both hands. The wai may be made while sitting, walking, or standing. The person who is junior in age or status is the first one to offer the wai meanwhile the senior person returns the wai, generally with their hands raised to somewhere around their chest. If a junior person is standing and wants to wai a senior person who is seated, the junior person will stop or bow their head while making the wai. If there is a great social distance between two people, the wai will not be returned. If invited to a Thai home, then allow your host and hostess to introduce you to the other guests. This enables other guests to understand your status relative to their own, and thus know who performs the wai and how low the head should be bowed.
In Thailand, even Ronald McDonald offers the wai gesture to greet.

Like wayang kulit, wayang wong is also accompanied by a large-scale court gamelan orchestra.The performance is an intricately complex whole, where the concept of time and the structure is dictated by the gamelan’s soft and elaborate fabric of sound, further elaborated by the recitation, songs, and comments of the chorus.

      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">Kathak is the principal classical dance of north India. Named after ancient bards known as the Kathakaris, it originally was a religious story-telling dance performed in temple courtyards and village squares but later under the Mughals developed as a court dance. It features women and to a lesser extent men dancing to the rhythm of feet slapping on the ground and is know for its twirling movements. The three main schools of Kathak dance, or “gharanas”, are in Lucknow, Varanasi and Jaipur.Kathak dancers traditionally related stories and moral tales of gods and goddesses and characters from the “Ramayana” and “Mahabharata”. The earliest forms were stories told by bards embellished with hand gestures and facial expressions. Over time music was added and the gestures and movement grew into dances. Kathak dance, which contains both Hindu and Muslim traits, includes narrative elements, often from tales of the Hindu deities Krishna and Radha or stories from the Mahabharata. Kathak dance has two main techniques “nritya” pure dance and “Abhinaya” expressions. Describing a kathak dancer, Mike Edwards wrote in National Geographic, she "reverently touched the feet of her guru and received with his blessing, her rope of ankle bells. Then to the staccato thump of the guru's drum, her feet stamped, setting the bells ajangle. Her hands flow in crisp motions, her body spun in precise pirouettes. The costumes of Kathak dancers resemble those seen in Mughal miniatures. Both sexes wear tight-fitting trousers, ankle bells and, full gathered or pleated “ghagra” skirts with a “choli” for women and a long-sleeved jacket and often traditional “topi” hat for men.</p>
